      <p class="text-center"><strong> During this semester there have been many ups and many downs, and many 
	  stalls brought on through my own procrastination. I like to look back and imagine this semester
	  in this class as a bit of a Role-Playing Game (RPG). I entered the class as a Level 0, and I am 
	  leaving the class as a Level 2, with the max level being put at 5. I had many experiences with the
	  students in the room that I really wouldn&#39t trade for the world, much like in an MMORPG 
	  (Massive-Multiplayer-Online-Role-Playing-Game), I have picked up some vital information that
	  I will carry with me throughout the rest of my journey as a student of Kent State University,
	  much like finding some awesome loot after slaying the big-evil monster during a certain stage.
	  Most of all I feel as if I am leaving this class with an experience that cannot be changed, or
	  given to anyone else, because it was so close to me and me only. I made the choice to come to 
	  Kent State, and I made the choice to enroll in the College Writing I class with the professor
	  being Alexis M Baker. Much like an RPG where you will choose a certain character, embark on
	  massive quests that take you down a long and spiraling path and you finally even up right where
	  you should be, with every experience behind you, such a great memory to have, and yet not many
	  share the same memory. I know this may not make sense in context, but it makes sense to me.
